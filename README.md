This repo contains the script asked for the interview to FSE position
Assume that you are sequentially reading integers from an array. 
Write a program that generates median (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) of the numbers that have been read so far. 
We are interested in the approach and coding skills. You can write the program in ANY language. 
Please do not write a program to calculate mean. 
Eg: Lets say numbers that are read = 5, 2, 8, 10, 1 After reading 5: median = 5 After reading 5,2: median = ((5+2)/2) = 3.5 
After reading 5,2,8:median = 5 And so on...
